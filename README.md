A guided Django project based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t10QcFx7d5k">Django Project â€“ Code a CRM App Tutorial by freeCodeCamp</a></br>
This is my first Django project. The tutorial used MySQL as DB, I opted to use PostgreSQL hosted in AWS.

**Started**: 2023 October 29 </br>
**Completed**: 2023 November 4

**1104 Issue**: Styles for forms doesn't take effect. Still investigating this, will get back to this in a while :)
